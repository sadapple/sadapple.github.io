[![Proof of Acadia Milky Way](/media/files/2014/11/AcadiaMilkyWay.jpg)](http://www.douban.com/photos/photo/2210978378/)

When I traveled to Acadia this August, one friend was suspious about
the visibility of the milky way there during summer. And that night, I
found this proof.

From last night, I studied how to use jekyll and git together to write
a blog and it seems rather interesting and promising. I use the whole
template from Linghua Zhang and would like to thank him for creating
this beautiful jekyll template. I'm going to modify and learn from it gradually.
