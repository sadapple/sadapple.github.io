Tonight I read an intersting org mode tutorial written in Chinese,
I pick up some thing that I don't know before. Here are some of them:
* How to sum two specific colunms for all rows in an org table?
* How a run a code chunk in org directly and return the results?
* How to create lists in org and use the checkbox?
* Some useful environments in org, like title, comment, quote, center,
example.
* How to see the picture specified in a hyperlink of org file?(C-c C-x
  C-v)

Then I got the idea that I could migrate my notes in Lyx into Org
files, but then realized that I first need to solve the Chinese input issues
in Emacs. I searched online and found two approaches but they all fail
on my current Ubuntu 14.04 which made me a little bit sad = = I will
revisit this problem when I have time.

Finally, I decide to pick up some git commands by writing this post
then push it to my github blog in command line. If you see this post,
then I've succeeded :)
